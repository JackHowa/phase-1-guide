## Recipe for an Awesome Pairing Session

1. Mini Check-in: Talk with your pair about how they are feeling that day/week.  Is there anything going on in your life that may effect your pairing?

2. Pairing and Learning Styles: talk out different approaches. What factors contributed to their best pairing session and what factors contributed to their worst pairing session?

3. Discuss your goals today. What are your technical goals?  Where do you want to focus your learning?  What about pairing or giving/receiving feedback do you want to work on?  What are your meta-learning goals?

4. Talk about skill differences. How are they feeling about the days material?  Taking the risk to name skill differences up front allows the pair to navigate these differences so neither individual feels left disengaged with the material.

5. Agree on ways to celebrate success and deal effectively w/ frustration and blockages (and follow through!)

Pairing is a huge part of your DBC experience, and it's important to think of pairing as a learnable skill, just like any technical proficiency you're working on. It can be very hard to become a good pair and ask others to do the same, so it's best to start practicing these habits early, and stick with them each day.

That said, sometimes the difficulty comes from a toxic interpersonal dynamic.

If you are finding that a specific pair dynamic is so difficult that it is actively hindering your ability to learn anything at all, please let your cohort lead know right away.
